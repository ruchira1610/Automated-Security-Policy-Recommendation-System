## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup  

### **Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **pip (Python Package Manager)**
- **Libraries - pandas, regex, openai**
- **Sample Network/Firewall rules text file (network_logs.txt - available here)**

### **Step 1: Step-Up API Credentials**  
1. Login to Gemini
2. Create API Key
3. Copy the key to Notepad for further use

### **Step 2: Open any Python IDE and run the code**  
1. Paste the code as given in the securityRecommender.py file
2. Copy and Paste the path of the newtork_log.txt file in for attribute "YOUR_NETWORK_FILE_PATH"
3. Copy and Paste the API Key for "YOUR_API_KEY"
4. Run the code 

### **Ouput**
1. The program listed all the Network Rules found in the network_log.txt
2. The program then listed Unsafe Network Rules it found in the network_log.txt
3. With the help of Gemini, it recommended the changes that needs to be done for each unsafe rule in a tabular format
